Question – Given the provided data, what are three conclusions that we can draw about crowdfunding campaigns?

Three conclusions that can be drawn about crowdfunding campaigns is as follows:

•	Based on the analysis of Parent Category, we can conclude that the Theatre category is the most crowdfunded category and the most crowdfunded sub-category is Plays based on analysis of Sub-Category. 

•	Based on the analysis of Parent Category, we can conclude that Journalism is the least crowdfunded category but has the highest success rate of 100%.

•	Based on analysis Outcomes per month, we can conclude that the most successful crowdfunding was in the month of June and July. 
 
Question – What are some limitations of this dataset?

  While the fields contain adequate information regarding various data points about crowdfunding, the number of records is limited to 1000 and I think having larger dataset would help better understand the data and crowdfunding stats. 

Question – What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create, and what additional value would they provide?

•	The other possible graphs that we could create would be on column of outcome, rows of country and values based on the count of outcome and filters based on parent category – this would provide insight into number of crowdfunds in various categories across countries. 

Statistical Analysis – 

Question – Use your data to determine whether the mean or the median better summarizes the data

•	Based on the box plot and data, median summarizes the number of backers for successful or failed campaigns in better way. 

•	As there are more outliers in both successful and failed category, the mean of the backers count do not provide clarity on the actual backers count whereas median is more representative of the actual backers count.  
 
Question – Use your data to determine if there is more variability with successful or unsuccessful campaigns. Does this make sense? Why or why not?

•	Based on the Standard Deviation which is 1266.224 for successful category and 959.9868 for failed category we can determine that the overall backers count is less variable in failed category than successful category.
•	This makes sense as there are more and far outliners in the successful categories, hence we see more deviation in this category compared to failed category.
